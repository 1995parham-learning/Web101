## Introduction

These examples are very wide because I'm not a frontend developer and just trying to teach
myself concepts.

## Projects

Each project contains static files for CSS, JS and HTML.
You can run by:

```bash
cd <project>/
firefox index.html
```

or

```bash
cd <project>/
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
